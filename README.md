# Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification

We'll apply all the knowledge from the lectures in this section to write a deep neural network. The problem we've chosen is referred to as the "Hello World" of deep learning because for most students it is the first deep learning algorithm they see.

The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition.

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). 

The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes. 

Our goal would be to build a neural network with 2 hidden layers.
